# ThrowEverything
Adds a new ability to throw (almost) any item in Lethal Company. Throw items to deal damage, distract enemies, trigger landmines, and more with this new mechanic!

## Known issues
- Not all items can be thrown, mainly specific special items with custom behaviour that interferes with the mod.
- There is no configuration for the mod currently, I'm hoping to add some soon.
- The mod is in BETA! Testing has not been extensive and there may be issues.

## Contact
You can find me (@Spantle) in the Lethal Company Modding Discord server or the Unofficial Lethal Company Discord server.

The mod has a thread in their #mod-releases channels.
